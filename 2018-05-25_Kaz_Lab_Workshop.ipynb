    "2018.05.25\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create, launch, and run commands in an interactive Python ([IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)) notebook\n",
    "- Load single timepoint or time series data from a plate reader using `pandas`\n",
    "- Convert plate reader data into the \"tidy\" format, and join your raw data to metadata in a plate map\n",
    "- Make exploratory plots which compare different variables and subsets of your data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Un-objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will **not** teach you Python in general; our goal is to learn just enough Python that you can make useful plots. Likewise we are going to use several giant and complicated libraries—but only very small parts of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will focus on quickly generating plots for exploratory data analysis—I will not cover the numerous options for generating publication- (or even presentation-) quality plots."

    "Let's first get acquainted with the notebook. This notebook is part of a project called [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org), which, in general, lets you write and run code \"interactively\"---that is, you write a little snippet of code, then run it and see the results. You can keep repeating this, and your variables live on across multiple snippets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, your notebook is sending these commands to a program—called a \"kernel\"—which executes the commands, keeps track of your variables, and sends you the results. (In this case, the kernel is [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), but [you can use many other programming languages as well](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)!) **This means your variables stick around as long as the kernel stays alive.** If you close this browser window and return to it later, your variables will still be there. If you restart your computer, the notebook server, or the kernel, you will have to re-run the cells in your notebook to get your variables back.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **It makes your analysis reproducible**; given your notebook and your data, someone else could repeat the exact same analysis to verify your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **It makes it analysis verifiable**; since there is a record of the exact commands you ran, someone else can read your code to see if you have made a mistake, an invalid assumption, etc. If you are copying and pasting data from Excel into Prism, there is no way for someone else to check that every range was copied correctly. If you make a mistake, it can be silently propagated through your thinking and analysis, and your conclusions could be completely wrong! "

    "I mostly included this to highlight an alternative plotting library, called [plotnine](http://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). Plotnine is a port of [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), a very popular package for R based on the [\"Grammar of Graphics\"](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387245447). This concept is very appealing, because it's much more flexible than even what we've been able to do with Seaborn.\n",

    "The basic idea is that a graphic is composed of **layers** stacked to create a complex plot. Each layer can map several \"aesthetics\" (like `x`, `y`, and `hue` as we've seen, but also `size`, `stroke`, `marker`, etc. depending on the type of layer) to different variables in the data. This allows, in principle, an amazing variety of plots to be created with remarkable simplicity. See examples [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html). \n",

    "Pythonistas have long waited for a worthy replacement for `ggplot2`, and `plotnine` has only appeared relatively recently. I'll admit, I haven't quite gotten the hang of it—the documentation is somewhat sparse compared to Seaborn, assuming that most people using it will know how to use `ggplot2`. It seems a bit rough around the edges in a few places (it causes pandas to shout tons of warnings), but it will be interesting to watch."
